# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
In this school district analysis exercise, I've been tasked with re-calculating school district math and reading test totals due academic dishonesty (altered grades) discovered for Thomas High School ninth graders.  To uphold the state-testing standards, I needed to remove the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders from the calculations.

My code to fulfill this exercise can be accessed here: [https://github.com/legeren/School_District_Analysis/blob/34dec4291b0ec8cd638a0b1e2aee27b5449481e5/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb]

## Results: 
The following summarizes how the removal of Thomas High School 9th graders' reading and math scores affected the state-testing results.

- How is the district summary affected?
  - The district summary showed 

- How is the school summary affected? Thomas High School summary was skewed after removing the 9th graders' test results, lowering the school's average (see before image).  By fixing the totals and removing the 9th graders' test results from the equation, the passing % were normalized.
